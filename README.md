# 👋 Hi there

I'm a Back-End Software Developer based in Alicante, Spain, with a passion for coding and continuous learning. Currently completing my CS degree at UNED, I've ventured from Front-End development into a diverse range of technologies, including React, Go, Java, and now Python.

## Currently

- 🚀 **Rebuilding my Portfolio**: Recently, I've rebuilt my personal portfolio from scratch, focusing on simplicity and speed without compromising on features. If you're interested in the code, you can check the repository [here](https://github.com/dnlzrgz/portfolio).
- 📊 **Happimo, a Mood Tracking App**: I'm developing a self-hosted mood tracking and journal application, aiming for simplicity and insightful statistics.
- 🎮 **Learning Godot**: For some time, I've wanted to delve a bit into game development with Godot. At the moment, I'm learning the basics and a bit of GDScript.
- 🇩🇪 **Learning German**: Recently, I passed my C1 certification exam and now I'm trying with German, aiming for B1 proficiency by summer's end.
